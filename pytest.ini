# Timeout configuration (pytest-timeout plugin)
# E2E tests must complete within 180 seconds (3 minutes) to allow for:
# - Certificate generation (can take several seconds)
# - User creation in bulk (can take several seconds)
# - Log retrieval (can be slow on first access)
# This ensures fail-fast behavior if user actions hang or block
